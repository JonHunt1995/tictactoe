# tictactoe app
Implementing and refactoring a tic-tac-toe game in Java.
- - - -
## Current roadmap for tictactoe app
- [ ] Needs better error handling for user input (currently working on)
- [ ] Currently, if a player puts in incorrect input, they lose their turn. Would like to reset turn if invalid input placed.
- [ ] UI updates for CLI app (to-do)
    1. Change from coordinates to numbering squares 1-9
  2. Make an actual grid for the tic-tac-toe board
  3. Change default character to ' ' instead of '#'
